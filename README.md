# Fold Properties By Default

I have seen people on the official forums who have been wanting to have the metadata/frontmatter properties folded by default. I think this should be implemented as a built-in option, but for the time being, I came up with a simple way to achieve the same behavior.

There are no settings; it basically just checks if the metadata properties are unfolded. If they are, then I call the built-in command to toggle them to their folded state.

**Especially useful to those who want to keep properties out of the way without hiding them entirely.**
